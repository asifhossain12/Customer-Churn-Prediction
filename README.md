# 🚀 Customer Churn Prediction Using ANN 🎯

Welcome to the **Customer Churn Prediction** project, where we leverage the power of Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) to predict whether a customer will leave or stay with a business based on historical data. This project aims to analyze churn behavior and help businesses retain valuable customers by using machine learning techniques.

---

## 🔍 Project Overview

Churn prediction helps companies understand which customers are likely to stop using their services. This project focuses on building a neural network model to predict customer churn, and it involves several stages like data preprocessing, feature selection, model building, and evaluation.

🔑 **Key Features:**
- **Data Preprocessing**: Handles missing values, scales features, and encodes categorical variables.
- **Neural Network Architecture**: Implements a multi-layer ANN model using Keras and TensorFlow.
- **Performance Evaluation**: Measures accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

## 🧠 Model Architecture
The ANN model architecture consists of the following layers:

Input Layer: Takes in customer data (e.g., tenure, contract type, monthly charges).

Hidden Layers: Multiple fully connected layers with ReLU activation.

Output Layer: Single output neuron with sigmoid activation for binary classification (churn or no churn).

##🛠️ Technologies Used

Python 🐍

TensorFlow 🔥

Keras 🤖

Pandas 📊

NumPy 📈

Matplotlib 📉


##📊 Evaluation Metrics

The model is evaluated based on:

Accuracy: How often the model makes correct predictions.

Precision: The ratio of true positive predictions to all positive predictions.

Recall: The ratio of true positives to actual positives.

F1 Score: Harmonic mean of precision and recall.


## 🌟 Results

The trained ANN model achieves impressive results with high accuracy and low false positives. Further fine-tuning and cross-validation ensure the robustness of the model across different datasets.
